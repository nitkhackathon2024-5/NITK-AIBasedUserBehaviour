## Project Overview
This project was developed during the Wells Fargo Hackathon, where we aimed to create an intelligent system for predicting user adoption and engagement for various banking features. The application uses machine learning models to analyze user personas and provide insights into potential pain points and adoption probabilities for features like smart assistants, card management tools etc.
## Features
- **User Input**: Collects user data such as age, tech savviness, income, persona, and selected feature.
- **Prediction Models**: Utilizes pre-trained machine learning models to predict adoption probabilities and expected engagement based on user input.
- **Pain Point Analysis**: Provides users with specific pain points related to their persona and the selected banking feature.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Flask, Python, scikit-learn
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Data Handling**: NumPy, Pandas, Pickle
- **Machine Learning**: RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingRegressor
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## Installation Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nitkhackathon2024-5/hcwl.git
   
## Install Dependencies
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
